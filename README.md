# Python Notebooks for Data Science

This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks covering various topics in statistics and machine learning for data science applications. The notebooks provide shallow explanations, examples, and coding exercises to help solidify understanding.

## Contents

The notebooks are organized into the following categories:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics, data visualization, exploring datasets.
2. **Probability Distributions**: Basic probability theory, random variables, distributions.
3. **Statistical Inference**: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals.
4. **Linear Regression**: Simple, multiple linear regression models, and polynomial regression. Discussion on linear regression assumptions with code examples.
5. **Logistic Regression**: Binary and multiclass classification using logistic regression, with various performance metrics.
6. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Support vector classifiers (SVC) and support vector regression (SVR)
7. **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)** 

This list will be updated continuously as more notebooks are added

## Usage

To use these notebooks, you'll need Python along with common data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, etc. Each notebook has the necessary import statements.
You can view the notebooks statically on GitHub. However, to modify code and re-run, you'll want to clone or download the repository locally.

## Acknowledgments 

The core of some ntebooks were adapted from the excellent [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hamelg/python-for-data-analysis-index) resource on Kaggle by Hamel Husain. I have enriched the original notebooks with additional explanations, examples, and exercises.

## Contributions

While I aim to ensure accuracy, these notebooks may have errors. If you spot any issues or have suggestions to improve the content, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
