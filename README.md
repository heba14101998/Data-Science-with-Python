# Hands-on Data with Python

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks covering various data science topics, with a focus on practical applications using Python. The notebooks are designed for beginners and anyone looking to learn data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Topics Covered

**1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**

- **`python-for-data-21-descriptive-statistics.ipynb`**: Covers descriptive statistics, data visualization, and understanding key metrics for data analysis.
- **`python-for-data-22-probability-distributions.ipynb`**: Introduces basic probability theory, random variables, distributions.
- **`python-for-data-23-hypothesis-testing.ipynb`**:  Explains hypothesis testing, confidance interval, t-tests, and how to perform them in Python.

**2. Feature Engineering and Selection:**

- **`python-for-data-26-feature-selection.ipynb`**:  Explores feature engineering techniques to improve model performance, covers different feature selection methods, and demonstrates their implementation.

**3. Machine Learning Algorithms:**

- **`python-for-data-27-linear-regression.ipynb`**: Introduces simple, multiple linear regression models, and polynomial regression. Discussion on linear regression assumptions
- **`python-for-data-28-regression-analysis-and-glmm.ipynb`**:  Expands on regression analysis, including generalized linear models (GLMs).
- **`python-for-data-29-logistic-regression.ipynb`**:  Covers binary classification using logistic regression, with various performance metrics using this [book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grokking-machine-learning/9781617295911/Text/06.xhtml#heading_id_12) as reference.
- **`python-for-data-30-support-vector-machine-svm.ipynb`**:  Explores Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a versatile algorithm for both classification and regression tasks.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heba14101998/Hands-on-Data-with-Python.git


## Usage

To use these notebooks, you'll need Python along with common data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, etc. Each notebook has the necessary import statements.
You can view the notebooks statically on GitHub. However, to modify code and re-run, you'll want to clone or download the repository locally.
