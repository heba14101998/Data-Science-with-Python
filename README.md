# Python Notebooks for Data Science

This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks covering various topics in statistics and machine learning for data science applications. The notebooks provide shallow explanations, examples, and coding exercises to help solidify understanding.

## Contents

The notebooks are organized into the following categories:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics, data visualization, exploring datasets.
2. **Probability Distributions**: Basic probability theory, random variables, distributions.
3. **Statistical Inference**: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals.
4. **Linear Regression**: Simple, multiple linear regression models, and polynomial regression. Discussion on linear regression assumptions with code examples.
5. **Logistic Regression**: Binary and multiclass classification using logistic regression, with various performance metrics.
6. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Support vector classifiers (SVC) and support vector regression (SVR)
7. **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)** 

This list will be updated continuously as more notebooks are added

## Usage

To use these notebooks, you'll need Python along with common data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, etc. Each notebook has the necessary import statements.
You can view the notebooks statically on GitHub. However, to modify code and re-run, you'll want to clone or download the repository locally.

## Installation

To run these notebooks locally, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Required libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, scipy)

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```
Alternatively, you can use Kaggle or Google Colab directly to access and run the notebooks online.
